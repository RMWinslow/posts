: "The government buys a certain amount of seats per day to various destinations. Say, DCA to LAX. Big companies, like Apple, do the same. If you need the seat, you have it. If you don’t, it goes empty. ... The gate agent explained to me that 16 seats were technically sold, but they were government & would probably go empty."

[Yali (politician) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yali_(politician))

[Doxa, Episteme, and Gnosis.](https://mapandterritory.org/doxa-episteme-and-gnosis-ea35e4408edd)
: Doxa: Hearsay. "If you know the Earth is round because you read it in a book, that’s doxa."
: Episteme: Reasoned knowledge. "If you know the Earth is round because you measured shadows at different locations and did the math to prove that the only logical conclusion is that the Earth is round, that’s episteme."
: Gnosis: Personal experience. "If you know the Earth is round because you traveled all the way around it or observed it from space, that’s gnosis."
: The essay suggests that it's easy to confuse these different forms of knowledge. The reason that teaching is the best way to learn something is that is forces you to develop Episteme and not just Doxa.

[Tumultuous tax brackets | FRED Blog](https://fredblog.stlouisfed.org/2018/09/tumultuous-tax-brackets/)g
: The top marginal tax rate was above 90% until 1964.
: Note, however, that basically nobody paid that rate.
: [According to Piketty and Saez](https://eml.berkeley.edu/~saez/piketty-saezJEP07taxprog.pdf), there were lower capital gains taxes, and plenty of deductibles, so the *effective* top marginal tax rate wasn't nearly that high.
: The federal tax code really was a lot more progressive in the 60s but that's a result of high coporate and estate taxes, not the high marginal income tax. (See Figure 1 in the linked paper.)

[GPS Accuracy](https://www.gps.gov/systems/gps/performance/accuracy/)
: As a kid, I had been told that civilian GPS is required to be less accurate, but according to gps.gov, 
: "The user range error (URE) of the GPS signals in space is actually the same for the civilian and military GPS services. However, most of today's civilian devices use only one GPS frequency, while military receivers use two... Dual-frequency GPS equipment is commercially available for civilian use, but its cost and size has limited it to professional applications."


[Learning from the first (and only) manufactured housing boom | Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis](https://www.minneapolisfed.org/article/2025/learning-from-the-first-and-only-manufactured-housing-boom)
: Early state-by-state regulation of manufactured housing ("mobile homes") actually helped the industry by promoting consumer trust.
: But the federal regulation required that the chassis be permanently attached, which spelled doom for the industry. The chassis makes it difficult to include a basement or permanently attach the home to a foundation, resulting is uglier and less safe homes.

[Brígido Lara - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Br%C3%ADgido_Lara)
: "Lara claims to have created perhaps as many as 40,000 pieces of forged pre-Columbian pottery. ... In July 1974, Mexican police arrested a group of what appeared to be antique smugglers, with Brígido Lara among them. An antiquities expert declared Lara's forgeries genuine. While serving his prison sentence, Lara requested fresh clay, and to prove his innocence, he created just the items he was accused of smuggling."

[An article about Fritz Darges](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/6461171/Memoirs-of-Hitler-aide-could-finally-end-Holocaust-claims.html)
: 'During a strategy conference a fly began buzzing around the room, landing on Hitler's shoulder and on the surface of a map several times. Irritated, Hitler ordered Darges to "dispatch the nuisance". Darges suggested whimsically that, as it was an "airborne pest" the job should go to the Luftwaffe adjutant, Nicolaus von Below. Enraged, Hitler dismissed Darges on the spot. "You're for the eastern front!" he yelled. And so he was sent into combat.'
: Originally seen on twitter as ["German guy came up with a good joke for the first time and got immediately sentenced to death"](https://x.com/LadelaBackup/status/1916201427384311936)
: Ironically, the reassignment may have saved Dargess life, as two days later an assassin detonated a briefcase bomb in that room in an attempt to kill Hitler.

[An end to all this prostate trouble?](https://yarchive.net/blog/prostate/)

[The Hidden Cause of Food Deserts - The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/12/food-deserts-robinson-patman/680765/)
: My prior for "food desert" stories is to be skeptical. It's a very buzzworded topic. But even absent that, there's an interesting antitrust story here. The Robinson–Patman Act is law from 1936 banning suppliers from price-discrimination when selling to retailers. The Atlantic piece argues that lack of enforcement of the act is to blame for a reduced number and variety of grocery stores. [Here's another article arguing the same point.](https://ilsr.org/articles/policy-shift-local-grocery/)
: The act is back in the news because [the FTC recently sued a large wine and spirits distributor for violating the act](https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/cases-proceedings/2110155-southern-glazers-wine-spirits-llc-ftc-v).

[Lab-grown teeth might become an alternative to fillings following research breakthrough | King's College London](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/lab-grown-teeth-might-become-an-alternative-to-fillings-following-research-breakthrough)
: It's just an incremental result about getting cells to differentiate into tooth-making cells. But still, exciting stuff!

Also, here's a random thought that I probably could look up but have decided not to because it's fun to have an unsupported crackpot theory sometimes: 
Why did birds lose their teeth? Was it just a flight-weight thing? Or did it coincide with the evolution of caries causing bacteria?
