I'm offloading a lot of saved links from my phone from a very long time span. Well over a year and a half, at least. 

[easing functions cheat sheet](https://easings.net/)

[Hyperinflation and trust in Ancient Rome](https://notesonliberty.com/2019/09/16/hyperinflation-and-trust-in-ancient-rome/)

The Fed has "[Blackout Periods](https://www.stlouisfed.org/about-us/resources/blackout-periods)" during which certain people at the fed aren't allowed to talk about their work. Ran into this when a speaker at a conference realized he put the dates in his calendar wrong. He was able to ask other people questions but had to cancel his own talk.

[A History of Microwave Ovens - taylor.town](https://taylor.town/history-of-microwave-ovens) - I think I saved the link in part because the styling on the page is cute.

[Commonly used arm positions can substantially overestimate blood pressure readings](https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-10-commonly-arm-positions-substantially-overestimate.html) - [hn](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41840023) - I've used a blood pressure analogy a few times to explain how GDP and similar measurements are useful even despite the the weirdness. What makes certain measurements useful isn't *just* accuracy. It's also the fact that they are reasonably  1. consistent, 2. predictive of things we care about, and 3. practical to collect.

One thing I keep telling myself I should do is incorporate more interactive gamelike activities into my lectures. [Here's a website - econoclass - with some examples which might serve as inspiration](http://www.econoclass.com/games.html).

["Custom exempt" meat](https://extension.sdstate.edu/meat-not-sale) is where a firm slaughters and processes an animal for you and gives you the meat. It's stamped with a "NOT FOR SALE" emblem. The idea is that way you don't need all the paperwork and inspections to turn your own pig into sausage or whatever, and the catch is just that the meat can't be sold or donated. (Doesn't stop people from trying to sell it on Facebook anyways.)

[Fact or fiction: Do redheads feel more pain?](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/fact-or-fiction-do-redheads-feel-more-pain) - The same gene that makes a person ginger also interacts with pain perception. Certain kinds of anesthesia are less effective for redheads.

[The Yankees very briefly had a mascot named Dandy.](https://nypost.com/2019/08/03/how-the-yankees-first-and-only-mascot-became-a-total-embarrassment/) It went terribly. The owner hated him. Fans attacked him. The Yankees offered to renew the contract for the license, but they wouldn't agree to pay for the bodyguard to protect him.

> ‚ÄúI fell off the stage, and they just lunged at me,‚Äù Ford said. ‚ÄúI heard somebody scream, ‚ÄòUnzip his head! Unzip his head!‚Äô I was pretty scared.‚Äù

[Mechanical Watch - Bartosz Ciechanowski](https://ciechanow.ski/mechanical-watch/) - A beautiful interactive explanation. There are a lot of other good explainers on this website as well.

["Galapagos Syndrome"](https://medium.com/@alxgcs/understanding-the-galapagos-syndrome-through-japans-unique-quirks-967dcbc05d47) is used to describe how Japanese smartphone design followed a different evolutionary trajectory.

[Demographics of Manhattan - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Manhattan) According to the chart on this page, the population of Manhattan peaked around **1910**, presumably related to the wave of immigration? The other boroughs of NYC have increased in population since then.
(The WP sources just link to a non-time-series census page, so I'll want to come back and doublecheck this little fun-fact sooner or later.)

[Simon Magus - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Magus) - Simon Magus is a guy mentioned in *Acts* who is described as a sorcerer and tries to pay the apostle Peter to teach him how to do miracles. Later non-biblical works give him all sorts of crazy powers, like the ability to fly, and exaggerate his meeting with Peter into straight-up anime nonsense.

![The death of Simon Magus, from the Nuremberg Chronicle](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Death_of_simon_magus.jpg/645px-Death_of_simon_magus.jpg)

[The Most And Least Attractive Male Hobbies](https://datepsychology.com/the-most-and-least-attractive-male-hobbies/) - Results are about what you'd expect but more importantly: According to this survey, 12% of women find it **attractive** when men collect Funko Pops and argue with people online. Either online surveys are incredibly unreliable, or there's somebody out there for everybody.


[Go First Dice](http://gofirstdice.ericharshbarger.org/doku.php). There are sets of dice that, when rolled together, will each display a unique number and where each dice has an equal chance of being the highest. (Useful for deciding who goes first in a board game.) Elegant solutions exist for up to four players. 5 players requires 60 sided dice. 6 requires a total mess.ma

[matrixmultiplication.xyz](http://matrixmultiplication.xyz/) - Cute little matrix multiplication visualizer. Good for if I ever need to explain matrix multiplication to students. [Github repo](https://github.com/staltz/matrixmultiplication.xyz)


[Disappearing polymorph - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disappearing_polymorph). Some chemicals can form multiple different kinds of crystals. Sometimes the presence of even microscopic amounts of one variant acts as a seed which makes the chemical always take on that crystal form. Two years after going on the market, HIV drug Ritonavir suddenly stopped working because it all started crystalizing into a form that the body can't absorb. 


[Necromolds](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/294986/necromolds-monster-battles) is a miniature wargame when you make the soldiers out of playdough and smash them when they die. Sounds like a mess, but gosh, what a cute idea.

[QUIZ: RAT OR MOUSE?](http://ratbehavior.org/QuizRatOrMouse.htm)

The city of Xico, near Mexico city, sits next to a volcanic crater with farmland inside. [It makes for some striking images](https://www.amusingplanet.com/2014/03/the-volcanic-crater-of-xico.html). Also: One proposed etymology for "Mexico" is navel of the moon, and this the Hill of Xico reminds me of a bellybutton. Coincidence? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

[Is my blue your blue?](https://ismy.blue/) (My boundary is at is at hue 171, "greener than 72% of the population")

[Radical Cartography](http://www.radicalcartography.net/?projectionref) - Cool website with lots of maps and map projections.
See also [map-projections.net](https://map-projections.net/imglist.php) and [Mapthematics](https://mapthematics.com/ProjectionsList.php).

[Females in the Labor Force 1880-2000](https://journeys.dartmouth.edu/censushistory/2016/02/16/females-in-the-labor-force-1880-2000/) - Someone told me that women's labor force participation initially fell as production shifted towards manufacturing before rising again in the late 20th century. Census data back to 1880 doesn't exhibit that pattern EXCEPT for non-white non-married women, but plausibly they were the last subset of women who experienced the dip. Verdict on the original claim: ehhh, maybe? Would be interested in a time series that goes back farther.

[Jianpu rendition of Take Me Home, Country Roads](https://www.jianpu.net/qupu/92058.html) - Don't remember why I bookmarked this. I think because Eddie got a little toy piano mat?

[The Suez canal was first built around 1850 BC](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Suez-Canal/History). It was filled in around 779 and wasn't rebuilt until the 1860s.

[Dualshock - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DualShock#DualShock_2) - The PS2 controller basically codified the set of inputs on modern game controllers, but one feature that nobody else copied was the fact that *all* of the buttons are pressure sensitive and allow for analog inputs. Odd, never noticed this as a kid.

[Studies in Intelligence](https://www.cia.gov/resources/csi/studies-in-intelligence/studies-in-intelligence-68-no-1-extracts-march-2024/) - The CIA has a magazine, apparently. Found a link to this issue when reading about Lumumba.

> This might explain a curious fact: The Lumumba story
resonates more widely outside the Congo than in it. There
is no Patrice Lumumba People‚Äôs Friendship University
in Kinshasa, only in Moscow (its European accreditation
was suspended after the Russian invasion of Ukraine). An
award-winning film about Lumumba‚Äôs life was produced
and directed by a Haitian.
No statue of Lumumba presides over Kinshasa‚Äôs main thoroughfare, Boulevard 30
juin, even though no one had a bigger role than Lumumba
in making that date meaningful in the nation‚Äôs history. He
has no namesakes in major cities or airports and his name
is rarely evoked by Kinshasa‚Äôs political leaders today.
Lumumba is a symbol, but, preoccupied with the daily
challenges of survival, not for most Congolese. 

[Thecodontia](https://www.thecodontia.com/) - Cool dino skeleton illstrations.

[Ivar the Boneless - Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivar_the_Boneless) - Historical viking. Stories disagree about why he was called "boneless".

[The Great Frost of 1683 - Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Frost_of_1683%E2%80%9384) - Worst winter in British history froze the River Thames. Upside: great opportunity to have a party on the river.

I noticed that South Dakota and Missouri use little chibi versions of their state outline on road signs. It turns out [each state has it's own state highway symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numbered_highways_in_the_United_States#State_highways). The creativity varies quite a bit. 
[Here's a Highway Shields Tier List maker.](https://tiermaker.com/create/us-state-territory-highway-shields-175749)

[Dungeons & Dragons taught me how to write alt text ‚Äì Eric Bailey](https://ericwbailey.website/published/dungeons-and-dragons-taught-me-how-to-write-alt-text/)

[The bizarre secrets I found investigating corrupt Winamp skins / Jordan Eldredge](https://jordaneldredge.com/notes/corrupted-skins/) - See also [his other posts on Winamp](https://jordaneldredge.com/tag/winamp/). Surprisingly interesting.

[Henneguya zschokkei - wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henneguya_zschokkei) - "It is the only known multicellular animal that does not require oxygen to survive." - Basically a jellyfish that evolved into a tumor.

Related: our friend henneguya is likely an example of a [SCANDAL](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6343361/), a Speciated-by-CANcer-Development AnimaL

[Power Thesaurus](https://www.powerthesaurus.org/) - Much broader and more useful than a traditional thesaurus. Fun to play around with.

[Seven Sages](https://www.livius.org/articles/people/seven-sages/). See also.[Seven Sages of Greece - Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Sages_of_Greece) 
- Thales of Miletus, the first philosopher,
- Pittacus of Mytilene, the tyrant reformer,
- Bias of Priene, the greatest of advocates,
- Solon of Athens, who laid the foundation for its democracy,
- and Chilon of Sparta.

Then there's a lot of disagreement about who else should be included in the list. I feel like if these guys showed up in an anime, they'd throw in Pythagoras and Aesop.


[The lost empire of Tartaria](https://www.historicalblindness.com/blogandpodcast//the-lost-empire-of-tartaria) - for people who think Atlantis is too mundane of a story. A lost empire sinking into the sea? Nah, how about a lost empire sinking into the *dirt*?

[Konjac - Wisconsin Horticulture](https://hort.extension.wisc.edu/articles/voodoo-lily-amorphophallus-konjac/) - Strange plant, cousin to the corpse lilly. We got a couple of these from Augsberg and I'm trying to follow the advice on this page to keep them alive.

[How bad is maternal mortality in the U.S.? A new study says it's been overestimated](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2024/03/13/1238269753/maternal-mortality-overestimate-deaths-births-health-disparities) - there was a change in how deaths are reported, so the supposed increase in US maternal mortality over time and relative to other countries is just a an artifact of inconsistent data definitions. Measuring things is hard.


[Meth. We're On It.](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/18/us/south-dakota-meth.html) - a rather... creative slogan for an anti-drug campaign.

[How wild turkeys went from extinct to everywhere in Minnesota](https://www2.startribune.com/wild-turkeys-minnesota-extinction-endangered-species-conservation-success/600223880/) - Turkey populations were wiped out in MN, but after several attempts, they were successfully reintroduced from the Ozarks.

[Google released a report about their medical diagnostic AI, AIME](https://research.google/blog/amie-a-research-ai-system-for-diagnostic-medical-reasoning-and-conversations/) - Provocative result: the graph reports that the AI by itself did better than either doctors on their own, or doctors with AI assistance. The text of the article seems to dance around that result, and it's best not to extrapolate performance on one very specific test, but still... quite provocative.


[Comptroller Stringer: Cost of Incarceration per Person in New York City Skyrockets to All-Time High](https://comptroller.nyc.gov/newsroom/comptroller-stringer-cost-of-incarceration-per-person-in-new-york-city-skyrockets-to-all-time-high-2/) - In NYC in 2021, it cost over half a million dollars to keep someone in jail for a year.


[Is Grad School Worth It?

[Teddy Roosevelt‚Äôs Bold (But Doomed) Battle to Change American Spelling](https://www.history.com/news/theodore-roosevelt-spelling-controversy) - In response to German spelling standardization and reform, Teddy Roosevelt advocated for similar changes to English. Some caught on -- we write "jail" instead of "gaol", "draft" instead of "draught" -- but the suggestion to replaced "-ed" suffixes with a "t" was widely ridiculed.

[A Tax Rule Change Is Threatening the Survival of Some Businesses](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-tax-rule-change-that-is-threatening-businesses-survival-a9236658) (October, 2023) - In brief, R&D is tax deductible, but gov said you now have to spread out those deductions over 5 years. Some R&D-heavy firms were faced with a tax bill larger than their actual profits. Especially troublesome: [the law change also says software development counts as R&D now](https://x.com/stephenprater/status/1735135151703875991). The tech job market was TERRIBLE in the 2023-24 job search season, and I'd guess this is a big part of the reason why.

## Links from the hospital

Links from the hospital, back in August 2023: Ah, these provoke some bittersweet memories. Based on the timing, I must have saved these links on my phone on the days surrounding my son's birth.
- [Arrest of Active Labor - OB-GYN 101](https://oacapps.med.jhmi.edu/OBGYN-101/Text/Abnormal%20L&D/Arrest%20of%20Active%20Labor.htm) - The jargon for what happened was that our delivery was complicated by absolute feto-pelvic disproportion. He got stuck. He was in the perfect position and everything; he was just a *tiny bit* too big. Dilation paused at around 9cm. As per the last paragraph, my wife then went through a "trial of labor", which meant she spent 30 hours waiting to see if the baby could squeeze out. That didn't work and so we had to go to C-Section.
- [Safe Prevention of the Primary Cesarean Delivery | ACOG](https://www.ajog.org/article/S0002-9378(14)00055-6/fulltext) - C-sections are scary; they're a major surgery! So naturally you hope that things will just resolve themselves. One of the things I found while frantically trying to do a literature survey in the birthing room is that in the US, doctors often turn to C-sections too readily, and are too quick to say that labor has been arrested. For new mothers, it isn't uncommon for labor to take 20 hours or more. ... Maybe that means we'll be fine just waiting a bit longer? But alas, scroll down to the recommendations table, and it turns out our doctors were following the new, more conservative guidelines. And after eight hours with no dilation progress, things were pretty conclusive: the baby was stuck. <!--Original link "withdrawn": https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/obstetric-care-consensus/articles/2014/03/safe-prevention-of-the-primary-cesarean-delivery
-->
- [GetWellNetwork Games](http://games.getwellnetwork.com/Games.html) - Fortunately, the C-section went well. We had a few days in a hospital suite to recover, and there was a tablet provided with some janky games. None of the games are really very good, but I had fun figuring out how to view the url for the webapp the tablet was accessing.
- I have a couple saved links from this time to the [python Polars graphing library](https://realpython.com/polars-python/) and [its user guide](https://pola-rs.github.io/polars-book/getting-started/reading-writing/#json). I had plans to get some work done on my job market paper in the hospital. But of course, that was a terribly silly thing to plan on.
- [Manufacturing a Backyard Hydrogen Generator: Update 3](https://nephewjonathan.substack.com/p/pythia-01) - No, I don't know why I though this link was important to save while I was in the hospital. No, I don't think I even read any of the other articles in the series. Sleep deprivation is the most likely culprit.

[Scott Aaronson's Big Number Talk](https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=3445) - An essay that escalates from asking kids to write big numbers on the board:
> The kid on the left writes something like: 999999999  
While the kid on the right writes something like: 11111111111111111
Looking at these, I comment:
9 is bigger than 1, but 1 is a bit faster to write, and as you can see that makes the difference here!   

to
> Anyway, the upshot of all of this is that, if you try to hold a name-the-biggest-number contest between two actual professionals who are trying to win, it will (alas) degenerate into an argument about the axioms of set theory.

I mostly remember it for the mention of well defined numbers (BB(n) for n > 1000) whose value cannot be proven, even in theory.

[Antebellum Puzzle - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antebellum_Puzzle) - In the 1840s and 1850s, the height of the US adult male population decreased, likely due to decreased per-capita food consumption. This happened because although there was an increase in agricultural productivity, population was also growing quickly, and because the biggest improvements to productivity were for non-food crops like cotton and tobacco, raising the opportunity cost of growing food.

> the assumed link in the textbook version of the money multiplier between the creation of loans and the creation of demand deposits is dubious. According to the standard multiplier theory, an increase in bank lending is associated with an increase in demand deposits. The data as discussed below do not reflect any such link

The text spends time arguing that reserve requirements are not a good tool for directly controlling the money supply, but also that the idea of the money multiplier being connected to total lending at all is empirically dubious. The latter claim is very provocative, and suggests I need to heavily rethink what I cover in my principles course.

Now we're getting into *really* old links from my phone.
