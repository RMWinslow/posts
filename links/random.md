[Examples of Unintended Consequences](https://reason.com/category/economics/unintended-consequences/)
: Most recent example in this blog's feed is the FDA labelling sesame seeds as a major allergen. There are now big fines for putting sesame seeds in food where it isn't listed as an ingredient. The result? Firms start adding a pinch of sesame to everything just so they can put it on the ingredient label.


[This jacana leg situation](https://www.australiangeographic.com.au/blogs/creatura-blog/2020/05/this-jacana-leg-situation-is-actually-adorable/)
: The jacana is a wading bird with doting fathers. A male Jacana will carry his chicks around under his wings.



[Cameron's World](https://www.cameronsworld.net/)
: A web-collage of text and images excavated from the buried neighbourhoods of GeoCities.

[Causal Inference for The Brave and True](https://matheusfacure.github.io/python-causality-handbook/landing-page.html)
: A clearly written online textbook, with example python codes, and plenty of humor. Fantastic stuff. Mostly deals with the estimation of average treatment effects.



[The Medieval Bestiary](https://bestiary.ca/index.html)
: Well-referenced site with details about medieval european beliefs about beasts, both real and mythical.
: The pages on real animals, detailing bizarres misconceptions, are my favorites. [Here's the page on elephants](https://bestiary.ca/beasts/beast77.htm), for example.



[Pseudodoxia Epidemica (1672)](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/pseudodoxia/)
: An interesting old document in which Sir Thomas Browne writes long essays about the common misconceptions that annoy him. Also contains the first recorded instance of the word "electricity".
: An example: [Book 3, chapter 21](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/pseudodoxia/pseudo321.html) carefully argues against the popular belief that Chameleons survive on air alone and don't need to eat any food.
: There's also [an accompanying document, written as a rebuttal to Browne](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/ross/index.html). Including, yes, [an argument that chameleons totally just need air to survive](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/ross/ross27.html#four) and that the reason they eat flies is for... uh... for fun?




[Literally Imagine Dragons](https://stephenskolnick.substack.com/p/literally-imagine-dragons)
: A blog post in which the first half is an educational description of porphyrins, and the second half is bonkers speculation about fire-breathing stegasaurs.


[infrastructure that looks like sci fi](https://twitter.com/kane/status/1646195380290306066)
: 


[Brain Maps](https://brainmaps.org/)
: Zoomable, hi-res images of tissue cross sections. Some of the images let you zoom in far enough to see individual cells.

[Wikimedia Gallery of Medieval Diagrams](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Medieval_diagram)
:    

[Nine Degrees Below Photography](https://ninedegreesbelow.com/photography/articles.html)
: color management, photography and painting using free/libre software. Articles about color spaces and the like. Probably more detail than you'd ever need to know.

[Jason Davies](https://www.jasondavies.com/)
: Lots of interesting visualizations, mostly of maps.

[Erich Friedman](https://erich-friedman.github.io/)
: Math Puzzles and visualizations

[Flags of the World](https://www.crwflags.com/FOTW/flags/)
: A website about flags. It's hideous. I love it. See, for example, [municipal flags of Kansas](https://www.crwflags.com/FOTW/flags/us-ksmun.html). Overland Park's flag redesign is especially baffling.


[Worldbuilding Pasta](https://worldbuildingpasta.blogspot.com/p/blog-page.html)
: Incredibly detailed blog posts about geographic features, and how to invent realistic geography for imaginary planets.


[Ming the Clam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ming_(clam))
: At 507 years old, Ming was the longest-lived individual animal. This fact wasn't discovered until after Ming was frozen and killed.


[Twitter's Whistleblower Report](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/interactive/2022/twitter-whistleblower-sec-spam/whistleblower_disclosure.pdf)
: There has been much ado over twitter drama since Elon Musk took over the company. But much more shocking and less talked about are the allegations made by a whistleblower back in July 2022. Twitter threads with highlights: [1](https://nitter.net/AvidHalaby/status/1602127460677844993), [2](https://nitter.net/TheMattBeebe/status/1601731247977693184). Among other things, Twitter was apparently doing development on the production environment.  



[Heavy Boots](https://www.phys.ufl.edu/~det/phy2060/heavyboots.html)
:    

[Vertical Castling](https://www.futilitycloset.com/2009/12/11/outside-the-box/)
: The rules of chess used to allow a King to Castle with a newly promoted pawn.

[Five Problems With Chess](https://www.pentadact.com/2022-11-10-five-problems-with-chess/)
: A game designer's complaints about the rules of chess. The highlight is a vulgar rant about En Passant

[Life Without Your Cerebellum](https://medium.com/know-your-body/life-without-your-cerebellum-b21e7b976aab)
: I knew that the cerebellum was responsible for 'muscle memory', but I didn't know that it contains half of your brain cells and "has some role in coordinating social stimuli as well as motor". If a person is born without a cerebellum, they can adapt and survive, but will be clumsy and socially stunted.

[The Commodordion](https://linusakesson.net/commodordion/index.php)
: A Functioning electronic accordion built from two Commodore 64 computers.

[Let's Learn About Waveforms](https://pudding.cool/2018/02/waveforms/)
: A short essay about sound with interactive visualizations (auralizations?)

[H3: Uber’s Hexagonal Hierarchical Spatial Index](https://eng.uber.com/h3/)
: Uber has a clever system for implementing a hex-grid tiling of Earth's surface. If you remember your geometry, you know there must also be 12 pentagons in the mix. Uber uses the [Dymaxion orientation](https://eng.uber.com/h3/) to place the center of each pentagon in the ocean. [Another link](https://t1nak.github.io/blog/2020/h3intro/). And [here is a python script which generates h3 shapefiles in QGIS](https://github.com/maphew/code/blob/master/gis/qgis/h3-in-qgis.md#preparation).


[TensorFlow Playground](https://playground.tensorflow.org/)
: Interactive visualization of an Neural Network as it learns.
