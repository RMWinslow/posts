"If you want to be an author, don’t start writing. In this example, writing every day is not a good project. Why? Because, according to Cal Newport, that’s not how the business works.The more effective strategy is to find an agent and start working together to pitch a book to publishers. Only once that has happened do you actually start writing the manuscript. Writing the book beforehand is largely a waste of time."
