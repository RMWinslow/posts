<!-- I was curious why the mile is 5280 feet. The Roman mile was 5000 feet exactly.
- There's a old Germanic system of measurement where 600 feet makes a furlong. 
- In Roman units, there are 625 feet in a stadium, and a stadium is 1/8 of a mile.
- Also the Germanic feet are about 10% bigger than the Roman feet 
- Roman soldiers bring their system of measurement to the isles. People keep using Germanic feet for 
- After they withdraw, Roman feet 

Problem 1: There are now two different feet and two different furlongs. The 
Problem 2: There are now two different ratios between feet and furlongs. -->







If "mile" means "thousands", why is the mile 5280 feet?  Sources online are contradictory and I think tend to miss the real answer.

When King Henry III and/or Edward I (we don't actually know which guy is to blame) standardized measurements, **he chose to use a relatively long furlong and a relatively short foot.**
Thus contrary to existing convention, 660 feet per furlong was enshrined in law. He didn't mention the "mile", but the damage was already done.

See, the old French mile was 10 furlongs of 600 Drusian feet each. Greece had a similar system. Meanwhile, the Roman Mile was 8 furlongs of 625 Roman feet each. 

Typical for England, they ended up with both systems using the the same names. King Hed/ward *could* have enshrined either of these two into law, but he decided to invent his own instead. 
625√ó8 gives a mile of 5000 feet (1000 paces). 600√ó10 gives a mile of 6000 feet (1000 fathoms). But 660? ...

Why did he do this? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è *Speculation: A shorter foot was used by wood workers as a vestige of Roman soldiers building forts[^compromise], while the longer furlong was used in land surveying. King Ed/ry wanted to make as few people angry as possible and figured the ratio just wasn't very important.*

[^compromise]: The English foot is a little bit longer than the official Roman foot, but standardization of the foot had lapsed for several hundred years at that point so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
<!-- I've seen speculation that the English foot is a compromise between the shorter Roman foot and the longer Drusian foot. -->

His standardization of the foot and furlong[^acres] have lasted to the present day. Miles, however, took another few hundred years to standardize.

[^acres]: You may think we don't use furlongs but an acre is 1/10th of a square furlong. It's called a "furlong" - "furrow long" because that's the length of a traditional field.







<!-- 
Suppose you're the king (we don't know *which* king is to blame) and you want to standardize units. You don't want to mess with the furlong because that's what all the fields are based on, so you have a few options:

- Make the Greek-style system official, establishing a foot as 1/600 of a furlong.
- or Adapt the Roman system, defining the foot as 1/625 of an English furlong. 

Option #2 will give you a foot midway between but there's no standardization right now anyways, so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è




Speculation: Perhaps carpenters were using the 

The second option  -->





<!-- (Do NOT ask about the Welsh mile.) -->


<!-- The reason is that there were multiple versions of the foot,
and when either King Henry III or King Edward I (we don't know which one to blame), -->

<!-- The reason is that when King... Somebody (Henry III or Edward I - we don't know which one to blame),
standardized English units of length, he opted for a compromise which, like all good compromises, made nobody happy. -->

<!-- In Roman units, a mile is 5000 Roman feet, and a stadium (translated into English as furlong) is 1/8 of a mile. So there are 625 Roman feet in a "furlong". -->
<!-- In Roman units, a mile is 5000 feet, and a stadium is 1/8 of a mile.  -->

<!-- In an another widespread system, the mile is 6000 Drusian feet and the furlong is 1/10 of a mile. So there are 600 Drusian feet in a furlong. -->
<!-- In an another widespread system, the mile is 6000 feet and the furlong is 1/10 of a mile.  -->

<!-- But the Drusian feet are longer  -->

<!-- As always happens with England, they end up with both systems. System number 2 is the one used -->






<!--

The stadium itself comes from Greek units, where its 600 Greek feet. Romans said, eh, call that 1/8 of a mile, nbd.

King We-don't-know-which-one made a bizarre compromise when standardizing units.


[This article from 1883](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/proceedings-of-the-royal-society-of-edinburgh/article/abs/2-the-old-english-mile/22BBACEB773956845A86B54F4AD12E49) makes a compelling case that the 10 furlong mile was very common.

[EtymOnline](https://www.etymonline.com/search?q=furlong) says furlong has been used to translate stadium into english since 9th century.
