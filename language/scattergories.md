I found a cheap copy of *Scattergories*,
which I bought just because I wanted to add the alphabet dice inside to my dice collection.
But I didn't want to leave the game unplayable, 
so I created a newer, better set of dice to use.

*Scattegories* where you compete to quickly come up with words in a category
which all start with the same letter.
The game comes with a chunky 20-sided die to determine which letter to use each round.
(The letters Q,U,V,X,Y,Z are missing.)

I have some blank 12-sided dice and used them to make new
"easy mode" and "hard mode" dice for the game.

The Easy mode dice has the letters: 
S,P,C,R,
D,F,M,T,
A,B,W,L

The Hard mode dice has the letters:
Q/K,X/Z,J,Y,
V,G,N,O
E,H,U,I

I chose the letter arrangement by looking at the unique word beginnings in *Alice and Wonderland.*

## Starting letter Frequencies

Here are some tables of letter frequency, as evaluated by the number of *unique* words in a corpus that begin with each letter.
