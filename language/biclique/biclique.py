This file takes in a word list and searches for a large "biqlique"
which here means a set of word endings and beginnings such that any
pair of endings and beginnings can be combined to form a valid word.

The inspiration is a toy I say called
"Fisher-Price Preschool Learning Toy Spin â€˜n Rhyme Fidget Spinner, Owl-Themed Early Reading Activity for Kids Ages 3+ Years"

The word set there is:
{p,b,m,h,r},{ad,at,ail,ay,ug}
Which gives the words:
p-ad, p-at, p-ail, p-ay, p-ug,
b-ad, b-at, b-ail, b-ay, b-ug,
m-ad, m-at, m-ail, m-ay, m-ug,
h-ad, h-at, h-ail, h-ay, h-ug,
r-ad, r-at, r-ail, r-ay, r-ug
