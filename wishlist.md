# Christmas Wishlist Ideas for Mom

Don't get everything on this list all at once. These are just some gift ideas. 
I'll add to this whenever I think of something, so bookmark this page.
Love you.

## Misc One-time gifts
- little CD player + any old kids music cds you still have laying around. Eddie likes listening to music on the ipad but hates the ads.
- 4TB Hard Drive
- Homemade Finn Hat. You made one of these for me from a pattern back before Adventure Time was a big thing. They sell Finn hats nowadays, but I don't want a mass-produced Finn hat. I miss the one you made for me.


## Repeatable gifts

- novelty socks (1 pair per year max)
- strange dice
  - bulk dice?
- pur gum

- spice mixes (Freddys, etc) (they store well, yiru likes them)

## Books

- bilingual story books (NOT books for learning chinese. like fairy tales in both languages)
- Biscuit and the Little Llamas 
- Replacement copy of *Peek a Who* (maybe, his is beat up but he's also outgrowing it)


## Board Games



### Expansions

- Clank Catacombs:
  - Clank!: Catacombs – Underworld
  - Clank!: Catacombs – Lairs and Lost Chambers
