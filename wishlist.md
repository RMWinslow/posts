# Christmas Wishlist Ideas for Mom

Don't get everything on this list all at once. These are just some gift ideas. 
I'll add to this whenever I think of something, so bookmark this page.
Love you.

## Misc One-time gifts
- sewing machine for yiru?
- big winnie the pooh?
- etch a sketch (the one he was playing with was checked out from the library) (make sure it's a big one)
- little CD player + any old kids music cds you still have laying around. Eddie likes listening to music on the ipad but hates the ads.
- Ikea Kallax inserts (2x [4 shelf inserts](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/kallax-insert-with-4-shelves-white-40423719/), and 1x [3x3 insert](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/kallax-insert-for-bottles-white-80401292/))
- PS5 controller? (usually on sale around black friday)
- Croft And Barrow Corduroy Pants (This brand of corduroy specifically has a nice high waist.) My current pair is 32x34 but it's a bit loose.
- 4TB Hard Drive + copy the digitized tapes onto it
- banana republic tshirts (no other brand - Yiru wants them to be easy to sort)
    - specifically some dark red ones - school colors and all that.
- Some USD shirts, (or maybe just red shirts) for the entire family. (To wear at parades and so forth.)
- Homemade Finn Hat. You made one of these for me from a pattern back before Adventure Time was a big thing. They sell Finn hats nowadays, but I don't want a mass-produced Finn hat. I miss the one you made for me.


## Repeatable gifts

- novelty socks (1 pair per year max)
- strange dice
  - bulk dice?
- pur gum

- spice mixes (Freddys, etc) (they store well, yiru likes them)

## Books

- bilingual story books (NOT books for learning chinese. like fairy tales in both languages)
- Biscuit and the Little Llamas 
- Replacement copy of *Peek a Who* (maybe, his is beat up but he's also outgrowing it)


## Board Games

- Did I buy board games and leave them at your house? (I already forgot) But some of those if so. Otherwise:
- Waterfall Park (Same rules as Chinatown.)


### Expansions

- Clank Catacombs:
  - Clank!: Catacombs – Underworld
  - Clank!: Catacombs – Lairs and Lost Chambers


### Legacy Games

- Clank! Legacy 2: Acquisitions Incorporated – Darkest Magic (This is "season 2" of the game we played with Caden)
