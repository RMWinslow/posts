"2. Consumption of fixed capital, or depreciation, is included in government gross output as a partial measure of the services of general government fixed assets; the use of depreciation assumes a zero net return on these assets."
3. Includes general government intermediate inputs for goods and services sold to other sectors and for own-account investment.
"4. Own-account investment is measured in current dollars by compensation of general government employees and related expenditures for goods and services and is classified as investment in structures, software, and research and development in table 3.9.5."
5. Includes federal purchases of research and development produced by state and local general government.
