"1. Equals consumption expenditures, government social benefits, interest payments, and subsidies; for federal government, also includes grants-in-aid to state and local governments and other current transfer payments to the rest of the world (net). Government, federal government, and state and local government current expenditures are shown separately in tables 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Or more simply, Current Expenditures Equals Consumption Expenditures + Current Transfers (+ Subsidies + Interest) ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2. Federal grants-in-aid to state and local governments are included in federal current expenditures; because the grants are transactions between levels of government, they are eliminated in the consolidation of the government sector.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"3. For more information regarding capital transfers, please see NIPA table 5.11.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4. Federal investment grants to state and local governments are excluded in the consolidation of the federal and state and local sectors.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5. Includes federal investment grants to state and local governments.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6. Consists of disaster-related benefits payments by state-owned insurance entities.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Notes:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The 3.15.5 is perfectly (within rounding error) recreated by adding Consumption Expenditures and Gross Investment in Each Category,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I am fairly certain the discrepancy between Social Benefits and Transfers comes entirely from ""Other current transfer payments to the rest of the world"". From Table 3.1, this discrepancy is 87.7 billion in total. And the other line items add up just fine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Two more categories needed for ""Total Expenditures"" not present here are the net purchase of non-produced assets and the deduction for consumption of fixed capital.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Capital Transfers are not ""Net""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Net borrowing is difference between Total Expenditures and Total Receipts. See Table 3.1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Per Table 3.10.5, 2. Consumption of fixed capital, or depreciation, is included in government gross output as a partial measure of the services of general government fixed assets; the use of depreciation assumes a zero net return on these assets.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
See Table 1.7.5 or 7.5 for details about CFC in order to get total expenditures for the sake of calculating eg deficit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
See Table 3.12 for Further Breakdown of Government Social Benefits,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
