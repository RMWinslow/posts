Government consumption expenditures and gross investment
: G part of C+I+G+NX. Includes Consumption and Investment.
: Table 3.9.5 breaks into down into C vs structures/equipment/IP
: Table 3.11.2 further breaks down military spending.
: Table 5.15.5 breaks it all down by function, without distinguishing between C and I.

Government current expenditures
: Consumption part of G, plus transfers, interest, subsidies
: Does not include the investment part of G
: So, for example: National Defense Spending is lower here than in the first definition of spending. 850 vs 1000 billion.
: Tables 3.1/3.2/3.3 have general breakdowns.
: Table 3.16 breaks it down by function.
: Table 3.17 has a further breakdown by function and spending type but is incomplete.

Total government expenditures
: Current expenditures + gross investment + other capital-type spending (eg buying land) - consumption of fixed capital?
: Tables 3.1/3.2/3.3 have general breakdowns.
: Table 3.17 doesn't have a detailed breakdown, but might be enough to generate the graph I want of G (+transfers etc.)

I just need to verify that 3.15 - I + $$$ is about the same as 3.16
