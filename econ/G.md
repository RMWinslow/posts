A few things to note:
- Housing and Community Services is mostly water, electricity, waste management.
- The market value of Gov purchases for GDP accounting is often just imputed as the cost of the input. 
    - For example, the salaries of IRS employees are included under "tax collection" and the salaries of many social workers are included under "Income Security".
- Transfers, Interest Payments, and Subsidies are not included. If we include those, the graph looks like the following:

The Breakdown of Social Security payments into its three components comes from [SSA ASS Table 5j](https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/statcomps/supplement/2025/5j.html). The total values at the top include payments to people living in Territories and abroad. In contrast, the values from BEA Table 3.12 separates transfers to non-US residents (Puerto Rico, mainly) into a separate line item. 

<!-- TODO: Figure out whether the interest payments block includes interest payments to the Social Security Trust Fund, etc. -->
