~~Counting sheep  / When you're trying to sleep,~~  
Counting Sales / On national scales,  
**Being fair  / When there's something to share,**  
~~Being neat  / When you're folding a sheet,~~  
Why we trade / How decisions get made,  
That's ~~mathematics!~~ economics!  


SKIP STANZA TWO FOR NOW
When a ball / Bounces off of a wall,  TODO  
When you cook / From a recipe book,  TODO  
**When you know / How much money you owe,**  
That's ~~mathematics!~~ economics!  


~~How much gold can you hold in an elephant's ear?~~  
How much time should you spend on your kids or career?
~~When it's noon on the moon, then what time is it here?~~  
When bonds boom in Hong Kong, what's the impact right here?  
~~If you could count for a year, would you get to infinity,~~  
~~Or somewhere in that vicinity?~~  
Would all markets clear, if we waited for a year... or something very near...(MODIFIED SCHEME: NEEDS REPLACEMENT)

~~When you choose / How much postage to use,~~  
**When you know / How much money you owe,**  (TODO: REPLACE. TRANSFERRED FROM STANZA TWO FOR NOW)
~~When you know / What's the chance it will snow,~~  
When you ***don't*** know / If your business will grow,  
**When you bet / And you end up in debt,**  
**Oh try as you may, / You just can't get away**  
From ~~mathematics!~~ economics!  



Andrew Wiles gently smiles,  
Does his thing, and voila!  
Q.E.D., we agree,  
And we all shout hurrah!  
As he confirms what Fermat  
Jotted down in that margin,  
Which could've used some enlargin'.  

Tap your feet,  
Keepin' time to a beat,  
Of a song  
While you're singing along,  
Harmonize  
With the rest of the guys,  
Yes, try as you may,  
**You just can't get away** 
**From ~~mathematics!~~ economics!**




## Fragmentary lyrics 

Time we spend / With our family and friends,

When we choose / Which resources to use,

Comments:
- incomplete, mangled meter and rhyme scheme
- Too much focus on the obvious, financial side of economics. (Those were the easiest lyrics for AI to help brainstorm.) I want the full song to focus more on behavioral, environmental, etc. The weird stuff, you know?
