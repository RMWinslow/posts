This is a poorly advertised feature, originally associated with Amazon's acquisition of Twitch.
Can claim games [at this link.](https://gaming.amazon.com/home).
<!--Decent summaries [here.](https://www.indiegamebundles.com/tag/amazon-prime-gaming/)-->

Default table order is in reverse chronological date of aquisition. 

A game with 0 thumbs up or down inspired no emotion in me. A game with both thumbs up and thumbs down inspired both frustration and awe.

    - Local: 
    - Okay. Sports.

    - Local:
    - Bad. 
    - Poorly Optimized. Slow. Dull autoscrolling. Stay in a spotlight as it slowly moves along. Pull a lever. Die because the edge detection on the light is iffy.
- Spellcaster University:
    - Okay.
    - I'm a fan of the concept. But the UI design is slapdash, poorly and inconsistently scaled.
- Youtubers Life OMG!
- Tales of Monkey Island

    - Local:
    - Okay. Cute arcady racer. A bit too chaotic to actually be engaging.

    - Local:
    - Good. Zelda Clone Roguelite.
    - There's lots of little side mechanics that don't really have any meat, but the core gameplay loop and combat engine are rock solid.

    - Meh. 
    - Only Played a few minutes. Visual style is unique but not super clear. Audio is a mixed bag. Gameplay consists of holding mouse button over a person when their health is low. Might be interesting later in the game, but the hook just isn't there. Cute little experiment though.

    - I think it's trying to a puzle game. But the gameplay loop is click on a glowing dot, wait a full minute for your little guy to slowly walk over to it, then click on the new glowing dot that appears.

    - It's a professor Layton style puzzle game, but the instructions and solutions are poorly translated, which ruins it. The *very first* puzzle has a errors in the solution translation.

    - Okay. 2D Platformer.

    - Cute style but nothing special.
- Monster Prom: Hotseat Edition
    - Local: I feel like playing a single game together would be more fun.
    - Good. Dating Sim.
    - It bills itself as a "competitive dating sim", but really it's a sort of parody of dating sims jammed into a rapid-fire choose your own adventure. The goal of a playthrough is ostensibly to find a date to the Monster Prom, but it's more likely you'll get attacked by the Pope for daring to expose the true origins of El Caganer or something like that. One shortcoming is that the game likes to get self-referential, but because the events are random, sometimes it will lampshade an event that you haven't actually seen yet.
- Swimsanity! (local only)
    - Local:
- Table Manners
    - Okay. Goofy simulator.
    - Attempts to be Surgeon Simulator but with a date at a restaurant. The gimmick and presentation are fun, but the game is horribly optimized, and some of the simulation elements are unresponsive. For example, I struggled to light a candle with a lit match. With this kind of game, they should err on the side of causing chaos. It should be *too easy* to start fires, not too hard.

    - Bad. 2D Platformer
    - Simple little game about a small child in a dangerous world. Occasionally it makes you walk through longer corridors while a voiceover waxes philosophically about color. And it irrationally annoyed me because all the stuff it says about colors is BS. No purple is not the farthest color, nor the most difficult for our eyes to distinguish. No, it's not a cultural universal that every culture calls the sky blue. And why on earth does this simple 2D platformer make my graphics card scream out in pain?! Are the background particle effects really that unoptimized?
