<!--TODO: analysis of all the ABC books on my shelf. I already have the spreadsheet.-->


"Xylophone" and "X-ray (Fish)" are the canonical "X" words.

![Poem lamenting the lack of words that begin with X](./alphabet_books/xword%20john%20travers%20moore.webp)

> What words begin with X?  
> Very few.  
> X-ray and xylophone  
> Will do.[^moore]  

[^moore]: Poem by Margaret and John Travers Moore. Originally appeared in *Certainly, Carrie, cut the cake*. The image here is from an excerpt in the poetry collection *Sing a Song of Popcorn*.

Very few words begin with X. An animal-themed alphabet book can fall back on taxonomy...[^reptile]

![X is for Xantusia riversiana](./alphabet_books/xword%20reptiles.webp)

[^reptile]: X is for *Xantusia riversiana* in Jerry Pallotta's *Yucky Reptile Alphabet Book*.

But otherwise it's a tricky letter. One of my kid's alphabet books has the gumption to use "Xeric"[^acrostic] for X. I can respect that. More common is for alphabet books to "cheat" by using a word that just *contains* X or by using X in its role as a symbol. Or they just stick with ol' reliable "Xylophone".

![Acrostic based on the word "Xeric"](./alphabet_books/xword%20summer%20acrostics.webp)

[^acrostic]: *Summer, An Alphabet Acrostic*, by Steven Schnur, uses both an obscure X word - "xeric" - *and* uses X as a symbol in the Roman numeral for twelve.


## What are the alternatives to "Xylophone"?

I wanted to check if there are any X-words we're missing out on.

I started by pulling up some lists of the most common words and filtering by starting letter. This is actually a bit tricky because word frequency depends on the corpus used.
The Wikipedia corpus is full of Chinese names. The Gutenberg corpus is full of Greek. The Google corpus - porn and webdev frameworks.

The Wikipedia word frequencies, pulled from [this Github repo](https://github.com/IlyaSemenov/wikipedia-word-frequency?tab=readme-ov-file), seemed best. I used an LLM to add simple annotations and then manually but zealously pruned the results. I've removed abbreviations, most proper nouns, and any brand name I don't personally recognize.

I've also seperated out taxonomy terms into their own list below, 
but "xenopus" and "xenarthra" are the only two I've ever heard,
and "xenopus" only because I saw it in an ABC book.
(Xenarthrans are sloths, armadillos, and anteaters.)
