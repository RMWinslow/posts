I used Claude/ChatGPT to parse and combine the PDFs. 
~~The numbers here seem correct,~~ but Claude also missed some.
(The robots were less helpful for plotting the data.)

Actually, a lot of numbers were wrong in bizarre ways. I think I've fixed them now.
Oh well, this LLM-generated chart still saved a lot of time.
Useful as a starting point, but always double-check your data!
